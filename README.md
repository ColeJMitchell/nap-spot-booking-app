//This will be where our documentation about our project will go

The basic organization of our project will be a directory that has an html, css,
and js file which will all handle the front end. In our database directory we 
will have our database that has three tables, user_information, nap_spots, and
favorites_list. More in depth explanations for the tables will be done shortly
and everything is subject to change.
